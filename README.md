I'm an freshman undergraduate studying Physics and Mathematics with a CS Minor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

Currently, my research is in Experimental Condensed Matter Physics where I'm studying the behavior of superconducting circuits known as "SQUIDs" under Professor Alexey Bezryadin.
